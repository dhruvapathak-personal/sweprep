# github

How to use GitHub. This skill covers the mechanics of the surface, not what to implement or how to judge a change.

## Tools

- Use the `gh` CLI, non-interactively. Pass `--repo <owner>/<repo>` on every command.
- Set `GH_PAGER=cat` on every `gh` invocation to disable paging. Do not pass `--no-pager` to `gh`; the GitHub CLI does not support it as a global option.
- Use `git --no-pager` for local operations; `--no-pager` is valid for `git`.
- Never merge a PR.

## sweprep routing

- The configured product repository is `dhruvapathak-personal/sweprep`; GitHub reports `main` as its default branch. Confirm the current base before branching. The canonical routing label is `factory:sweprep`; still resolve the current alias from `factory.yaml` as described below.
- The observed product tree has no PR template or CODEOWNERS. An API lookup for `dhruvapathak-personal/.github` returned 404, so an inherited template was not verified. Recheck the target repository before applying the default PR format or selecting reviewers; do not infer owners from a personal-account name.
- The factory-definition checkout is separate from the product repository. When `WARP_FACTORY_REVIEW_URL_TEMPLATE` is supplied, use the native Factory branch-review workflow instead of opening a GitHub PR: branch as `task/<last-8-task-uid-characters>/<slug>`, push that branch, substitute its URL-encoded name for `{branch}` in the exact template, and call `report_external_reference` with `reference_type: factory_review`. Do not push `main`. The generic `factory/<short-slug>` convention below applies to product PRs, not this native workflow.

## Branches and commits

- Branch off the repository's base branch. Confirm the base branch from the repository's conventions; do not assume `main`. Capture it once into a variable (e.g. `BASE_BRANCH=develop`) when you check out, and reuse that same variable everywhere a base branch is named - including the PR's `--base` - instead of typing a branch name again.
- Name factory branches `factory/<short-slug>`.
- The git identity and GitHub credentials for this run are already configured. Use them as-is; never set or override them, whether through `git config user.*`, `git -c user.*`, `--author`, or the `GIT_AUTHOR_*`/`GIT_COMMITTER_*` environment variables.
- A factory's or agent's display name belongs in labels, comments, and footers - never in a commit's author or committer field.

## Tracking issues

GitHub Issues in `dhruvapathak-personal/sweprep` is the selected tracker. GitHub repository access supplies issue operations; a separate Linear or Jira integration is not required.

- Search before creating: `GH_PAGER=cat gh issue list --repo dhruvapathak-personal/sweprep --state all --search "<terms>" --limit 50 --json number,title,url,state`. Read a match with `GH_PAGER=cat gh issue view <number> --repo dhruvapathak-personal/sweprep --json number,title,body,url,state,labels,assignees`. Adopt an existing issue for follow-up work instead of creating a duplicate.
- Create only when the work needs tracking and the request permits it. Write the issue description to a temporary file, then use `GH_PAGER=cat gh issue create --repo dhruvapathak-personal/sweprep --title "<title>" --body-file <file>`. Call `report_external_reference` with `reference_type: github_issue` and the returned URL, then apply the factory label using the section below.
- Update the description with `GH_PAGER=cat gh issue edit <number> --repo dhruvapathak-personal/sweprep --body-file <file>`. For a comment, use `GH_PAGER=cat gh issue comment <number> --repo dhruvapathak-personal/sweprep --body-file <file>` and follow the footer rules in Posting comments. Keep the issue's acceptance criteria and PR references current.
- Use native open/closed states. Keep work open through implementation and human review. When the tracked work is complete, use `GH_PAGER=cat gh issue close <number> --repo dhruvapathak-personal/sweprep --reason completed`. Do not invent project status, size, priority, or dependency fields; use optional metadata only after verifying the existing configuration and allowed values.
- Use only a supplied, verified GitHub login for assignment. Report authorization failures to the orchestrator; public issue reads do not prove write access. Do not switch trackers or create an issue merely to test permissions.

## Creating a PR

```bash
GH_PAGER=cat gh pr create --draft --repo <owner>/<repo> --head <branch> --base "$BASE_BRANCH" \
  --title "<title>" --body-file /tmp/pr_body.md
```

- Call `report_pr` immediately after `gh pr create` returns, before labeling the PR.
- Write the body to a file first. Do not inline multi-line bodies in the command.
- Size the body to the change, not the template - a body is as permanent as a comment. The implementation agent's PR description section sets the proportionality rule; this skill only carries the mechanics.
- Verify the creation: `GH_PAGER=cat gh pr view <pr> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json headRefName,baseRefName,changedFiles`. A wrong head branch, a `baseRefName` that does not match `$BASE_BRANCH`, or 0 changed files means the PR is wrong. Close it and create it again correctly.
- Promote when ready: `GH_PAGER=cat gh pr ready <pr> --repo <owner>/<repo>`.
- Update title or body: `GH_PAGER=cat gh pr edit <pr> --repo <owner>/<repo> --title "<title>" --body-file <file>`.

## Reporting the PR as a run output

Call the `report_pr` tool with the PR's HTTPS URL (e.g. `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/<number>`) and its head branch as soon as the PR exists in your run — whether you just created it or you adopted an existing one (e.g. picking up review of a PR opened earlier). This is what makes the PR show up as a run output in the UI; without it, nothing is recorded even though the PR itself exists. Adopting a PR is easy to treat as "nothing to report" since you did not open it — report it anyway.

## Labeling a PR or issue

Every PR and issue you open or adopt carries this factory's own label, `factory:<alias>`. Apply it as soon as you have the artifact in hand. For a PR, call `report_pr` first: the label fires this factory's labeled-PR automation, and a PR that is not yet reported starts a duplicate task instead of continuing yours.

Resolve the alias first. It is the top-level `alias` in the factory's own `factory.yaml`, checked out beside the skills listed in `WARP_SKILL_DIRS`. Resolve it once per run and reuse it:

```bash
skills_root="${WARP_SKILL_DIRS##*,}"
factory_root="${skills_root%/skills}"
factory_alias=$(sed -n 's/^alias:[[:space:]]*//p' "$factory_root/factory.yaml" | head -1 \
  | sed -e 's/[[:space:]]*$//' -e 's/^"\(.*\)"$/\1/' -e "s/^'\(.*\)'$/\1/")
```

An empty `$factory_alias` means the label is unresolved - warn and leave the artifact unlabeled. Never apply a bare `factory:`.

Canonicalize the parsed value the way the platform derives its own label (`deriveFactoryLabel` in `logic/factory_labels.go`), or a raw value can create a second, mismatched label instead of reusing the one the platform already manages:

```bash
factory_alias=$(printf '%s' "$factory_alias" | tr -s '[:space:][:cntrl:]' ' ' | sed -e 's/^ *//' -e 's/ *$//')
if [ "$(printf '%s' "$factory_alias" | wc -m)" -gt 42 ]; then
  factory_alias="$(printf '%s' "$factory_alias" | cut -c1-41)…"
fi
```

With the alias in hand, run the line that matches the artifact:

```bash
GH_PAGER=cat gh pr edit <pr> --repo <owner>/<repo> --add-label "factory:$factory_alias"
GH_PAGER=cat gh issue edit <issue> --repo <owner>/<repo> --add-label "factory:$factory_alias"
```

If no label exists, create it first then try re-applying:

```bash
GH_PAGER=cat gh label create "factory:$factory_alias" --repo <owner>/<repo>
```

Applying it blocks nothing: on failure, warn and carry on with an unlabeled artifact rather than aborting. Re-applying is free, so apply rather than checking first.

## Reading a PR

```bash
GH_PAGER=cat gh pr view <pr> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json title,body,headRefOid,baseRefName,files,isDraft
GH_PAGER=cat gh pr diff <pr> --repo <owner>/<repo>
GH_PAGER=cat gh pr checkout <pr> --repo <owner>/<repo>
```

## Reading all feedback surfaces

A PR has three comment surfaces. `GH_PAGER=cat gh pr view --comments` shows only one of them. Read all three, each with `--paginate`:

```bash
GH_PAGER=cat gh api repos/<o>/<r>/issues/<n>/comments --paginate   # conversation comments
GH_PAGER=cat gh api repos/<o>/<r>/pulls/<n>/reviews --paginate     # top-level reviews
GH_PAGER=cat gh api repos/<o>/<r>/pulls/<n>/comments --paginate    # inline comments
```

An empty result from one surface does not mean there is no feedback. For thread resolution state (`isResolved`, `isOutdated`), query GraphQL `reviewThreads` with a cursor loop.

## Posting comments

A GitHub comment is permanent and stacks in the PR timeline - be concise. Aim for 4 lines and 300 characters.

### Footer

End every comment - including replies from `scripts/resolve-threads` - with:

```
[Open session](<session url>) · [View in factory](<run url>)
```

Keep only these existing session and run links in run-backed replies; do not add automation or Factory identity text or a separate Factory link. No link back to the PR - redundant on the surface the reader is already on. Resolve the links once per run and reuse them. Drop either link that cannot be resolved, even both, rather than skipping the comment. Does not apply to the PR description or the managed attribution comment; see "Attribution comment" below.

- To @-mention a person in a comment, reply, or PR description, use the GitHub login provided to you. Never type a handle inferred from a display name, an email, or a chat handle.
- Resolve `FOOTER` once and reuse it verbatim for comments, reviews, and `scripts/resolve-threads --footer "$FOOTER"`. The internal `WARP_FACTORY_FOOTER_SESSION_LINK_RUN_ID` identifies the run eligible for "Open session" under the server's shared footer policy. Fetch the generic `session_link` only when that value matches the current `OZ_RUN_ID`; absent or mismatched metadata means omit "Open session", never infer eligibility from harness configuration or use an inherited run's policy. Missing, null, or empty links are omitted. When the session and current-run URLs match, keep only "View in factory".
- `$OZ_CLI` is the path or command the runtime exports; never hardcode the binary name. If the CLI, run ID, origin, or link is unavailable, omit that link:
  ```bash
  session_url=""
  if [ -n "${OZ_CLI:-}" ] && [ -n "${OZ_RUN_ID:-}" ] &&
    [ "${WARP_FACTORY_FOOTER_SESSION_LINK_RUN_ID:-}" = "$OZ_RUN_ID" ]; then
    session_url=$("$OZ_CLI" run get "$OZ_RUN_ID" --output-format json --jq '.session_link // empty' 2>/dev/null) || session_url=""
  fi
  run_url=""
  if [ -n "${WARP_FACTORY_ORIGIN:-}" ] && [ -n "${OZ_RUN_ID:-}" ]; then
    run_url="${WARP_FACTORY_ORIGIN%/}/runs/${OZ_RUN_ID}"
  fi
  FOOTER=""
  if [ -n "$session_url" ] && [ "$session_url" != "$run_url" ]; then
    FOOTER="[Open session]($session_url)"
  fi
  if [ -n "$run_url" ]; then
    FOOTER="${FOOTER:+$FOOTER · }[View in factory]($run_url)"
  fi
  ```
- "View in factory" opens the current run, not the Factory's activity feed. If neither link resolves, `FOOTER` is empty and the reply is still posted.

### Attribution comment

Post the managed attribution comment (`<!-- warp:pr-artifacts-comment start -->` / `<!-- warp:pr-artifacts-comment end -->`) right after creating the PR; when adopting one that already existed before this run, post it before your first other write to it instead. Check first: a comment already carrying both markers means it is posted - do nothing, and never resolve a duplicate yourself. It is exempt from the Footer above - post its body verbatim, with no footer. Use the run/conversation/thread links your brief supplied, not your own sub-run's, so the reader lands on the factory task - but swap only those `href` values and copy every other byte of the handed-down block, its image markup and both marker pairs included. Never rebuild it from memory. Not posting it blocks nothing - note it in your report and move on.

## Posting a review

Post the body and all inline comments in one API call:

```bash
cat > /tmp/review_body.md << 'EOF'
...
EOF
jq -n '[{"path":"src/f.py","line":42,"side":"RIGHT","body":"..."}]' > /tmp/review_comments.json
HEAD_SHA=$(GH_PAGER=cat gh pr view <pr> --repo <o>/<r> --json headRefOid -q .headRefOid)
jq -n --rawfile body /tmp/review_body.md \
  --slurpfile comments /tmp/review_comments.json \
  --arg event "REQUEST_CHANGES" --arg sha "$HEAD_SHA" \
  '{"commit_id":$sha,"body":$body,"event":$event,"comments":$comments[0]}' | \
  GH_PAGER=cat gh api repos/<o>/<r>/pulls/<pr>/reviews --method POST --input -
```

- `event` is `REQUEST_CHANGES`, `COMMENT`, or `APPROVE`.
- An inline comment must point at a file and line in the PR's diff. GitHub silently drops comments on unchanged lines. Verify each `path` and `line` against the diff first, and move the rest into the body.
- A suggestion block replaces exactly the commented line range. Keep the indentation exact, and do not include lines from outside the range.

## CI and mergeability

```bash
GH_PAGER=cat gh pr checks <pr> --repo <owner>/<repo>
GH_PAGER=cat gh pr view <pr> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus
```

- `mergeable: MERGEABLE` with `mergeStateStatus` of `CLEAN`, `BLOCKED`, or `HAS_HOOKS` is a healthy state. `BLOCKED` frequently means only that a review or branch protection is outstanding.
- `CONFLICTING`, `DIRTY`, or `BEHIND`: fetch the base branch and merge it into the PR branch. Do not rebase a branch that others share. Resolve only mechanically safe conflicts, push, and check again.
- `UNKNOWN` or null: GitHub is still computing. Retry a few times with short delays. Do not convert an unknown result into a claim of success.
- These commands are point-in-time reads. Do not block on CI: never sleep-and-recheck until the checks finish before reporting or handing off a PR. Report the current state and move on; a CI failure that lands later arrives as its own follow-up.

## Resolving review threads

After a revision addresses a review finding:
1. Reply in that thread with the commit that addresses it (link the commit SHA).
2. Resolve the thread through the GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` mutation, with the thread ID from the `reviewThreads` query.

Use the bundled script for both steps in one call, with `--footer` from Posting comments above:

```bash
scripts/resolve-threads --repo <owner>/<repo> --pr <number> \
  --thread-ids <PRRT_id1,PRRT_id2> --revision <N> --commit-sha <sha> \
  --footer "$FOOTER"
```

The script replies with a link to the commit, then resolves each listed thread. Do not resolve a thread without a reply that shows where it was addressed. Leave a thread that you did not address open, with a reply that says why.

Do not also post a summary comment - the per-thread replies are already the complete record.

## Reviewers

```bash
GH_PAGER=cat gh pr edit <pr> --repo <owner>/<repo> --add-reviewer <user>
GH_PAGER=cat gh pr edit <pr> --repo <owner>/<repo> --remove-reviewer <old> --add-reviewer <new>
```

The reviewer's GitHub login is provided to you. Never assume or guess a handle or login - ask the requester when you were not given one.

## Media in PR bodies

Embed screenshots or video links in the PR body markdown. Never commit media files to the branch.
